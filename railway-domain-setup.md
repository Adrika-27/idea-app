üöÄ RAILWAY DOMAIN SETUP GUIDE

Your Railway deployment is ACTIVE ‚úÖ but needs a public URL!

STEP 1: GENERATE RAILWAY DOMAIN
==============================
1. In Railway dashboard, click on your service
2. Look for one of these tabs/sections:
   - "Settings" tab
   - "Networking" section  
   - "Domains" section
   - "Public Networking"

3. Click "Generate Domain" or "Add Domain"
4. Railway will create a URL like:
   ‚úÖ idea-app-production-xxx.up.railway.app
   ‚úÖ your-service-name.up.railway.app

STEP 2: COPY THE URL
===================
Once you have the Railway URL, we need to:
1. Update vercel.json with the correct URL
2. Update your client environment variables
3. Test the registration

STEP 3: TROUBLESHOOTING
======================
If you can't find domain settings:
- Look for "Public Networking" toggle
- Check if port 5000 is exposed
- Make sure the service is set to "Public"

WHAT TO LOOK FOR:
================
‚úÖ Service shows "ACTIVE" (you have this!)
‚úÖ Deployment successful (you have this!)
‚ùå No public URL (this is what we need to fix)

Once you get the Railway URL, tell me and I'll update everything!

🚨 RAILWAY ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES SETUP
=========================================

⚠️  Your Railway app is not responding because environment variables are missing!

🔧 FOLLOW THESE EXACT STEPS:

1. 🚂 GO TO RAILWAY DASHBOARD:
   https://railway.app/dashboard

2. 📁 FIND YOUR PROJECT:
   Look for "ideaapp-new" project and click on it

3. ⚙️  CLICK ON "VARIABLES" TAB:
   You should see a tab called "Variables" - click it

4. ➕ ADD THESE VARIABLES ONE BY ONE:
   Click "Add Variable" and enter EXACTLY these name-value pairs:

   Variable Name: DATABASE_URL
   Value: mongodb+srv://adrika_new:adrikanew@cluster0.mb2ligy.mongodb.net/hackideas?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0

   Variable Name: NODE_ENV
   Value: production

   Variable Name: PORT
   Value: 5000

   Variable Name: JWT_SECRET
   Value: hackideas-super-secret-jwt-key-2025

   Variable Name: JWT_REFRESH_SECRET
   Value: hackideas-super-secret-refresh-key-2025

   Variable Name: CLIENT_URL
   Value: https://ideaapp-new.vercel.app

   Variable Name: SERVER_URL
   Value: https://ideaapp-new-production.up.railway.app

   Variable Name: CORS_ORIGIN
   Value: https://ideaapp-new.vercel.app,http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:5173

5. 🚀 AFTER ADDING ALL VARIABLES:
   - Railway will automatically redeploy (wait 3-5 minutes)
   - You should see deployment activity in Railway dashboard

6. 🧪 TEST WHEN DONE:
   - Visit: https://ideaapp-new-production.up.railway.app/health
   - Should show: {"status":"ok"}

💡 TROUBLESHOOTING:
- Make sure you're in the correct Railway project
- Double-check each variable name and value (no extra spaces)
- Wait for redeployment to complete before testing

🆘 IF STILL NOT WORKING:
- Check Railway logs for errors
- Verify all 8 variables are set correctly
- Try manual redeploy in Railway dashboard

## ðŸ”§ RAILWAY DOMAIN SETUP - MANUAL STEPS

Your server is running perfectly on port 8080, but Railway hasn't generated a public URL yet.

### OPTION 1: Railway Dashboard UI
1. Go to railway.app
2. Click on your "idea-app" project
3. Click on your service (the one showing ACTIVE)
4. Look for any of these:
   - "Settings" tab
   - "Networking" section
   - "Domains" button
   - "Generate Domain" option
   - A URL field anywhere on the page

### OPTION 2: Add PORT Environment Variable
Railway might need an explicit PORT variable:
1. Go to Variables tab in Railway
2. Click "New Variable"
3. Add: PORT = 8080
4. Redeploy

### OPTION 3: Force Redeploy
Sometimes redeploying helps Railway detect the port:
1. Go to Deployments tab
2. Click "Redeploy" or "Deploy Latest"
3. Watch for URL to appear

### OPTION 4: Contact Support
If none of the above work:
- Railway might have a UI issue
- Try refreshing the page
- The URL might appear after a few minutes

### WHAT WE KNOW WORKS:
âœ… Server running on port 8080
âœ… All environment variables loaded
âœ… CORS configured correctly
âœ… Database connected
âœ… JWT secrets working

Once Railway gives you the URL, your app will work immediately!
